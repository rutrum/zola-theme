This page has examples of headings, paragraphs, and lists.

# H1

Top level heading with content.

## H2

Second level heading with content.

These are different paragraphs.  Heres some text that I'm making up on the spot.  I wonder if I should have an LLM create this text for me.  But that might take too long.  I'd have to open a web browser, navigate to my local openwebui interface, ask a question.  Yeah, just asking the question is already going to take so many characters.  Then I have to copy and paste the response here!  That's proposterous, I wouldn't do that.
