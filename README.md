# Zola Theme

This is created since I wasn't pleased with any of the themes on Hugo or Zola.  I intend to use this exclusively for my personal blog.

## Goals

* light mode
* pictures should not be required for article cards
* customizable side bars
    * left or right side
    * table of contents for page
    * other articles/posts from a particular list
* nav bar (some don't have it)
* many layouts
    * pages
        * dependent on the presence of side bars
    * lists/taxonomies/archive
        * I've seen a couple layouts that I like
        * one with short 1/2 liners per article, sorted by date
        * cards with summary
* shortcodes
    * I personally use a gallery that I would like to clean up

Other general goals include
* minimal JS (hopefully none)
* very efficient mobile layout
    * for instance, minimal margins, no duplicate margins for code blocks

## Tools

I'm going to use tailwindcss for the first time.  Hopefully this helps eliminate decision paralysis and makes what I think I want actually turn out better than it has in the past.
